# Personal Portfolio

## Getting Started

I have updated this theme as a personal Portfolio. I have taken the inspiration (and basically all the code) from the wonderful work of andresjosehr you can visit his repo form https://github.com/andresjosehr/andresjosehr-portfolio and Britanny Chiang. You can visit her repo [here](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4)

>Many people have contacted me asking me if they can use this code for their own website, and the answer to that question is usually **yes, with attribution**.
I value keeping my site open source, but as you all know, _**plagiarism is bad**_. It's always disheartening whenever I find that someone has copied my site without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing this iteration of my website, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as your own.

As I have made an attribution to Brittany and andres.
